        <h1>Welcome to my website! take a look around, there isn't much here yet.</h1>
        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        My name is ralph scott, and I am an aspiring programmer from new zealand who loves the C programming language.<br/>
        You're probably here to admire my masterful web design ("CSS-less html is the new fad, as i have heard" (.w .))<br/>
        Some of my hobbies and interests include: coding, being bad at video games, and listening to music.<br/>
